Combine the flexibility of WordPress with the power of Genoo and experience amazing results!


== Description ==

The Genoo Plugin for WordPress has been crafted to address one of the most important challenges with WordPress sites - creating an easy way to engage site visitors, capture their contact information, and continue to engage them with relevant content based on their interests.

With the Genoo plugin installed, customers using WordPress as their website platform can now:

- Track all visitor activity and record it into the lead's Activity screen inside Genoo
- Automate emails based on site visitor actions
- Create content-relevant and buyer-stage calls-to-action (CTAs) and insert them on pages, into posts, or in sidebars - wherever they make the most sense based on your content
- CTAs can be images that change on mouse-over, or HTML buttons - your choice
- Integrate WordPress user levels with Genoo Lead Types - automatically - and then use Smart Rules to create deeper engagement
- Understand your approved commenters and add them to your lead database automatically
- Create and manage forms inside Genoo and present them in your WordPress site using a Genoo form theme or your site's CSS - use for calls-to-action, event registrations, and more - as popups or full forms -and the forms are responsive too.
- Form submissions on WordPress automatically create or update Genoo lead records - trigger automatic emails, nurturing sequences, or a variety of other activities

With the Genoo Plugin for WordPress, your site will engage visitors, entice them to provide their contact informaton, and increase your audience - which means, ultimately, that you will increase your sales!

1.  Add your Genoo API key and External Tracking script, and the Genoo plugin will automatically ensure that all lead activity on your website pages is tracked.  Once you save that information, you'll be able to set a Lead Type where all approved Commenters will be placed within your Central lead database within Genoo.
2.  Keep your Form look and feel as the default for your theme, or select from one of our themes.  The look and feel will be applied to lead capture forms you place onto your site pages.
3.  The External Forms you've created with your Genoo account are listed.  You select which one is the default "blog subscribe" form.  Using Shortcodes or our Widget to easily place the right form on the right page on your website ensures that all of your lead information resides in your Genoo account's centralized lead database, allowing you to automate actions and follow-up effectively.
4.  Push all existing subscribers and approved commenters to your Genoo account easily, and perform other housekeeping activities as needed. (note: once you push your existing subscribers and approved commenters, all NEW subscribers will be pushed automatically - just use the chosen Genoo blog subscribe form on your pages.  Approved commenters will be pushed across in real time to your Genoo account, as comments are approved).  Understanding which leads are commenting in addition to all their other activity is now seamless!
